If you can't express your feelings without rude words, the special chat will be added to your chats list, where swearing is allowed. You are allowed to send rude messages in that special chat only, but you must not touch the family and religious feelings of other users. If you continue swearing outside that special chat, you will be banned.</p>

		<h3>8. No flood</h3>
		<p>If you cannot express your feelings in normal adequate sentences and often send short messages without a reason, you can be banned and lose all your karma.</p>
		
		<h3>9. Do not annoy other users</h3>
		<p>If a user annoys other users either in group chats or in private chats, they may complain on his behavior. Users who receive many complaints may be automatically banned from AntiChat. Don\'t blame other users for banning your account. This community is similar to the offline world. We are sure that every banned user would suffer much worse in real life for their behavior.</p>
		
		<h3>10. Suspicious accounts</h3>
		<p>If a user breaks anti-spam, anti-flood, anti-porn filters or receive many complaints, his or her account will be flagged as suspicious. The most suspicious messages of suspicious accounts may be anonymously sent for review to the team of moderators. If moderators mark user's suspicious anonymous content as inappropriate, he or she will be banned from the system.</p>
		
		<h3>11. Karma</h3>
		<p>Users with adequate behavior usually have high karma. If you chat normally and help people express their feelings, your karma will grow. If you break rules, annoy other users and receive complaints, bans or blocks, your karma will be close to zero.</p>
		
		<h3>12. Banned users</h3>
		<p>If you are banned, you can rehabilitate. If you are banned in one chatroom only, apologise by sending private messages to every person who could be annoyed by your behavior. If they take your apologies you are allowed to join that chatroom again in few hours. If the offended users do not take your apologies, you may be banned in that chatroom each time you visit it again.</p>
		<p>If the system decides to lock you in Prison, you will be banned in all chats. Next few hours you will have to spend in Prison, chatting to other prisoners. The more you chat in Prison, the higher are your chances to recover half of your karma and get back to freedom. Be gentle, do not annoy other prisoners as they can also complain on your behavior and the system will prolong your sentence. There are no administrators who decide how long you should stay in Prison. The system is self-regulated, it automatically calculates your sentence depending on your violation. Users with lots of violations may stay in Prison for days.</p> 
		<p>If you continue violating or even creating new fake accounts, your device may be banned from AntiChat forever.</p> 
		<p>To shorten your sentence you may report other users who break rules. Press their avatars in group chats, then press the Report button.</p> 
		
		<h3>13. Listen to recommendations </h3>
		<p> If experienced users with high karma warn you, you better follow their recommendations. Otherwize the community might not accept the way you express yourself.</p>
